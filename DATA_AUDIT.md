## 3. SUMMARY OF DATA GAPS

### Critical Missing Data (Blocks Multiple Analyses)
1. **Shares Outstanding** - Needed for:
   - EPS calculation
   - Book Value Per Share
   - Market Cap validation
   - Per-share metrics

2. **Interest Expense** - Needed for:
   - Interest Coverage Ratio
   - Financial Health assessment
   - Debt service capacity

3. **Dividend Per Share** - Needed for:
   - Payout Ratio
   - Dividend sustainability analysis
   - Income investor assessment

### Secondary Missing Data (Limits Analysis Depth)
1. **ROIC (Return on Invested Capital)** - Advanced efficiency metric
2. **Intangible Assets** - For tangible book value calculation
3. **Preferred Stock** - For equity structure analysis
4. **Minority Interest** - For consolidated statement analysis

### Data Availability Summary
- **Total Data Points Needed**: 73
- **Available from API**: 58 (79%)
- **Missing from API**: 15 (21%)
- **Partially Available**: 2 (3%)

### Impact Assessment
- **Dashboard**: 100% operational (10/10 metrics available)
- **Fundamentals Agent**: 100% operational (13/13 metrics available)
- **Valuation Agent**: 77% operational (10/13 metrics available) - Missing: Shares Outstanding, EPS, Tangible Book Value
- **Financial Health Agent**: 88% operational (15/17 metrics available) - Missing: Interest Expense, Interest Coverage
- **Persona Agent**: 72% operational (18/25 metrics available) - Missing: ROIC, Dividend Per Share, Payout Ratio, Intangible Assets

2. Enhance balance sheet parsing for intangible assets
3. Add preferred stock identification

### Long-term Actions
1. Evaluate additional data providers for comprehensive coverage
2. Build data enrichment pipeline for missing metrics
3. Implement data quality scoring for each metric
